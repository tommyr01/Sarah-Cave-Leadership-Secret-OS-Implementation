## Archon Workflow Coordination

### Project Task Management Strategy

**Archon Integration Purpose:**
Archon MCP will serve as the central task management and knowledge coordination system for implementing Sarah Cave's Leadership Secret Operating System. This ensures systematic execution, progress tracking, and quality control throughout all implementation phases.

### Task Creation Triggers by Phase

#### Phase 1: Database Architecture Enhancement
**Archon Project Creation:**
```
Project Title: "Sarah Cave OS - Database Architecture"
Description: "Transform 5-table manual system into 8-table automated coaching business OS"
GitHub Repo: [Repository URL when available]
```

**Task Creation Schedule:**
- **Pre-Phase Research Task**: "Research existing Airtable schema and identify enhancement requirements"
  - Assignee: "AI IDE Agent" 
  - Feature: "database_analysis"
  - Sources: Current Airtable base structure, OpsKings methodology documentation

- **Database Enhancement Tasks** (Created automatically after research):
  - "Fix existing formula errors in Usage Frequency calculations" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent"
  - "Create Leads table with 15+ tracking fields" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent" 
  - "Create Deals table with sales pipeline stages" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent"
  - "Create Invoices table with financial tracking" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent"
  - "Establish table relationships and lookup fields" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent"
  - "Configure data validation and field options" → Assignee: "AI IDE Agent"

#### Phase 2: Manual View Configuration  
**Task Creation:**
- "Document view creation checklist for Sarah" → Assignee: "documentation-manager"
- "Create view specification templates" → Assignee: "ux-ui-designer"

*Note: Actual view creation remains manual for Sarah (8% of total work)*

#### Phase 3: Python Backend Development
**Archon Project Creation:**
```
Project Title: "Sarah Cave OS - Python Automation Backend" 
Description: "Serverless Python functions for webhook-driven business automation"
```

**Pydantic Agent Assignment Strategy:**
- **Backend Architecture**: "senior-backend-engineer" agent
  - Tasks: API design, webhook handlers, business logic implementation
  - Sources: Airtable API documentation, webhook integration guides
  - Code Examples: Existing serverless function patterns

- **AI Integration**: "ai-engineer" agent  
  - Tasks: OpenAI/Anthropic integration for lead scoring, note generation
  - Sources: AI provider API documentation, prompt engineering best practices

- **Infrastructure**: "devops-deployment-engineer" agent
  - Tasks: Vercel deployment, environment configuration, monitoring setup
  - Sources: Vercel deployment documentation, webhook security guidelines

#### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Quality Assurance Tasks:**
- "Validate webhook payload handling" → Assignee: "qa-test-automation-engineer"
- "Test lead scoring algorithm accuracy" → Assignee: "pydantic-ai-validator" 
- "Verify client health monitoring triggers" → Assignee: "test-writer-fixer"

### Archon Task Status Workflow

**Status Progression:**
1. **todo** → Research and planning phase
2. **doing** → Active implementation (only 1 task at a time)
3. **review** → Implementation complete, awaiting validation
4. **done** → Verified and deployed

**Progress Tracking Protocol:**
- Update task status immediately when starting work
- Use task descriptions to include acceptance criteria
- Add sources and code examples to tasks before implementation
- Mark tasks for review upon completion, not done
- Create follow-up tasks if issues discovered during review

### Pydantic Agent Specialization Map

**Implementation Phase Agents:**

1. **Database Phase**:
   - Primary: "senior-backend-engineer" (Airtable schema design)
   - Support: "documentation-manager" (schema documentation)

2. **Python Development Phase**:
   - Lead: "senior-backend-engineer" (core business logic)
   - AI Features: "ai-engineer" (OpenAI/Anthropic integration)
   - Infrastructure: "devops-deployment-engineer" (Vercel deployment)
   - API Testing: "api-tester" (webhook validation)

3. **UI Configuration Phase**:
   - Primary: "ux-ui-designer" (view specifications)
   - Documentation: "documentation-manager" (setup guides)

4. **Quality Assurance Phase**:
   - Testing: "qa-test-automation-engineer" (end-to-end testing)
   - Validation: "pydantic-ai-validator" (AI component testing)
   - Performance: "performance-benchmarker" (system performance)

5. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Infrastructure: "devops-deployment-engineer" (production deployment)
   - Monitoring: "infrastructure-maintainer" (system monitoring)
   - Documentation: "documentation-manager" (operational docs)

### Knowledge Base Integration

**RAG Query Strategy:**
- Before creating tasks: Query Archon knowledge base for similar implementations
- During implementation: Search code examples for relevant patterns
- Post-implementation: Document lessons learned for future projects

**Query Examples:**
```
perform_rag_query(query="Airtable webhook automation Python serverless", match_count=5)
search_code_examples(query="OpenAI API integration lead scoring", match_count=3)
perform_rag_query(query="coaching business CRM automation patterns", match_count=4)
```

### Project Milestone Coordination

**Milestone-Based Task Creation:**
- **M1: Database Complete** → Trigger Phase 2 documentation tasks
- **M2: Views Documented** → Trigger Phase 3 backend development  
- **M3: Backend Deployed** → Trigger Phase 4 integration testing
- **M4: Testing Complete** → Trigger production deployment tasks

**Cross-Phase Dependencies:**
- Database schema completion required before webhook development
- Python backend deployment required before view optimization
- Testing validation required before client handoff

This Archon workflow ensures systematic execution with proper agent specialization, knowledge base utilization, and progress tracking throughout the entire Leadership Secret Operating System implementation.

### Risk Mitigation
